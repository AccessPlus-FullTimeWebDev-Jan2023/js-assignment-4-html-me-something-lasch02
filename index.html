      <h2>Trip One - Girls Just Wanna Have Fun</h2>
      <p>In the 1900's (sounds really old, right?) - before the birth of the smart phone, there were rudimentary tools we used to get around, called maps - actual big sheets of paper with cities with roads and insets, folded up to fit in your purse or backpack.  We also had printed paper tickets for everything, and to capture a moment in time, we used something you may have heard of - a camera. With everything we have today to get around, order food and just in general, make navigating through life easier (you could look at the 1900's as a simpler time), my 3 friends and I took a trip to Europe.
