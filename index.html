      <p>Growing up, my family lived a very modest life - tiny home in South City with 5 people crammed inside. There wasn't much money for extras - dining out something that only happened a couple times a year.  We only got gifts just twice a year - our birthday and Christmas.  And when we went on vacation, it was the same place every year - my dad's friend's lake house at The Lake of the Ozark - the most amazing trip ever. We got to swim in the lake, play bumper pool (the coolest thing we had never seen before!), and go to the strip and pick out a souvenier - usually a blown glass figurine or a caricature drawn on velvet paper.  Those 7 days away from St Louis and being in a different place sparked my curiosity for new adventures. Years later, I made friends with people who also had the same passion for travel.  And so the story begins... 
      </p>
            <h2>Trip One - Girls Just Wanna Have Fun</h2>
      <p>In the late 1900's (forever ago, right?) - before the birth of the smart phone, we got around with a rudimentary tool, called a map - an actual big sheet of paper printed with cities, roads and insets; usually folded up to fit in your purse or backpack. Anywhere we went - we had a printed paper ticket (including airplane), and to capture a moment in time, we used something you may have heard of - a camera (separate from a phone). I am not sure how we managed, but somehow, my 2 friends and I backpacked through Europe.</p>
      <p>Our plan was simple - stay with our French friend's dad in Paris, France for a few days, then wih her mom in Toulouse, France for a few days, then off to other European countries. After France, we would go to Italy - Rome, then Naples. The final leg of the trip would be Greece - Athens, then the island of Isos. We would ride trains at night between cities/countries, so we didn't have to pay for hotel. On non-travel days, we would stay in youth hostels, and one night... my friend Heather convinced us to stay on a campground in her "really cool tent she bought on sale", that more or less resembled a trash bag with holes on both ends.
      </p>
      <p>All went well in France.... In Paris, we saw the Palace of Versailles, the Eiffel Tower, the Louve, and the Arc de Triomphe; and in Toulouse, we enjoyed the French countryside's cafes, it's famous red brick buildings, and delicious French food. On our way to Italy, made a quick stop in Cannes, France, know for the famous Cannes Film Festival. 
      </p>   
      <p>Italy was amazing. Rome (Roma) brought us the Colosseum, Vatican City (with literally a million pigeons!) and the Sistine Chapel. We had one night's stay in a campground, and that was too much to handle, so we sprung for hotels for our friend who was trying to convince us to camp again (UGH!!). Then off to Naples with luxury accomodations - Jules' cousin's house who ws stationed there by the navy.  In Naples (Napoli) we were introduced to Neopolitan pizza (not here yet in the US), and buffalo mozzarella (probably in the US but not popular yet...and we call it fresh mozzarella.  And yes...it was originally made from buffalo milk). We saw the Pompeii and Herculaneum (Ercolano), 2 cities that were once buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. We took a day trip to the Isle of Capri with stunning vistas, crystal clear blue waters, and the famous Faraglioni Rocks, of which I still have an original oil painting.  
      </p>
      <p>The final leg of our adventure was to Greece - first Athens, then the Greek island of Ios. I have not been back since 1991, but it was paradise and promise to take my family sometime. I loved the food, the people and the stunning white buildings with blue roofs scattered atop the hillsides.
      In Athens, we climbed to the top of the Acropolis (it was so hot that day!!) to see the famous temple, the Parthenon, which is over 1500 years old. From Athens, we had a few bumps in the road along the way - a full train heading to the port city and we got split up...I was with my friend Jules but we didn't know if Heather made it onto the train.  No cell phones then. By the time we arrived to the port city, we were too late to catch the boat to the islands, so we we had to stay overnight.  The next moring, we got our boat tickets and boarded the boat, only to have the boat take off from the marina stilled tied to the dock! The boat sat for 8 hours while being inspected - longer than the time it takes to get to the island. When we finally arrived in Ios, it was all worth it. A beatiful hotel for less than the price of some youth hostels, fabulous food, cool night clubs, crytal clear blue waters, white buildings with blue roofs, and the most beautiful silver jewelry sold for pennies on the dollar. We had a blast!! We loved it so much, we decided buy a few extra day by ditching the Eurail pass and flying home from Greece. Worth it!!

      <h2>Trip Two - Girl Meets Boy</h2>
      <article>
         <p>Phase two of my life... girl meets boy. When we met it was not love at first sight.  I was a design consulant for a home builder - Taylor Morle homes.  He sold homes for Taylor Morley. After repeatly asked me out, I finally gave in, and went on a date.  To my surprise, we had a lot in common - both liked to drink, both of us smoked, and we both liked to travel.  Our first trip together was Orlando. Fun but not romantic at all. It was the second trip we took together that sealed the deal - Puerto Vallarta. I had 2 critea for the hotel - a spa and on the ocean. He delivered and then some. The hotel we picked had an ocean view from every room, no buffets, and no kids. Puerto Vallarta is stunning - a beach town on a bay, with the Sierra Madre mountains above and the most gorgeous sunsets. While he went deep water fishing, I did the spa.  Together we went on a tour of the jungle, then hung out poolside, hit a few clubs, and hit the markets. We even found a restaurant that set up a table on the beach for us for dinner. We loved this city so much...we got married there!!
